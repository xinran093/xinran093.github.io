# Hi!

<h4> Hello & Welcome!

<h4> Me: </h4>

My name is **Xinran Zhu** (朱欣然 in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. student in [Learning Technologies](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/ci/academics/LearningTechnologies/) from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. I did my Master's degree in Educational Psychology at the University of Connecticut.

I am also working as an Instructional Designer to support online education initiatives at the university.

My research interests include computer-supported collaborative learning, learning analytics, network analysis, and design based research. I'm also investigating the ways in which big data informs pedagogical decisions in terms of techniques and ethics.

<h4> Random facts about me:
</h4>

- Essentials for a normal day: **coffee**.
- Essentials for a happier day: **cats** (my wishlist!)!
- My dream was to be a **filmmaker**.
- I want to learn drawing and painting this year.

<h4> I hope I can:
</h4>
I hope I can make an impact on the world in a good way. I hope someday I can call myself a researcher, a designer, and an artist. This is what I wake up for.
