<h4> Me: </h4>

My name is **Xinran Zhu** (朱欣然 in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. student in [Learning Technologies](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/ci/academics/LearningTechnologies/) from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities.

I am also working as an Instructional Designer for university instructors  to develop effective online learning environment and interaction.

My research interests are in the areas of learning analytics, learning sciences, online education, and more.

<h4> Random facts about me:
</h4>

- Essentials for a normal day: **coffee**.
- Essentials for a happier day: **cats** (my wishlist!)!
- My dream was to be a **filmmaker**.

I hope I can make an impact on the world in a good way. I hope someday I can call myself a researcher, a designer, and an artist. This is what I wake up for.
