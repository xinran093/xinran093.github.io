# I have a blog now!

<h4> Hello, Blog!
</h4>
After a whole weekend, finally, it's live now! I'm adding a quick first blog!

This site was powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with theme [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt/). I set it up by following a [Hugo tutorial session on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3/). The most time-consuming and challenging part is customizing, which required some understanding of each element/folder and knowledge of html and css (thanks to the Web Design course I took the last semester). I still have some design ideas for this site that need to be implemented in the future (too difficult for me now!). Overall, I think Hugo is very powerful for building websites. I probably would never be able to write hundreds of lines of cool code by myself.


<h4>This will be a place for my:</h4>

- **random ideas** for research;
- **random shots** of surroundings;
- **any product** I would like to share. :)
