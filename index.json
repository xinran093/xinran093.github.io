[{"categories":null,"content":" Hello \u0026 Welcome! Me: My name is Xinran Zhu (朱欣然 in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. student in Learning Technologies from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. I am also working as an Instructional Designer for university instructors to develop effective online learning environment and interaction. My research interests are in the areas of learning analytics, learning sciences, online education, and more. Random facts about me: Essentials for a normal day: coffee. Essentials for a happier day: cats (my wishlist!)! My dream was to be a filmmaker. I want to learn drawing and painting this year. I hope I can: I hope I can make an impact on the world in a good way. I hope someday I can call myself a researcher, a designer, and an artist. This is what I wake up for.

I'm adding a quick first blog! This site was powered by Hugo with theme LoveIt. I set it up by following a Hugo tutorial session on Youtube. The most time-consuming and challenging part is customizing, which required some understanding of each element/folder and knowledge of html and css (thanks to the Web Design course I took the last semester). I still have some design ideas for this site that need to be implemented in the future (too difficult for me now!). Overall, I think Hugo is very powerful for building websites. I probably would never be able to write hundreds of lines of cool code by myself. This will be a place for my: random ideas for research; random shots of surroundings; any product I would like to share. :) “Even miracles take a little time.” — Fairy Godmother, Cinderella.
